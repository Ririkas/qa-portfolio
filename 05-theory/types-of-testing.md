# Types of Software Testing

## Functional Testing
Verifies that the application works according to requirements.

## Regression Testing
Ensures new changes do not break existing functionality.

## Exploratory Testing
Simultaneous learning, test design, and execution.

## Acceptance Testing
Validates the system against business requirements.

## Usability Testing

## Integration Testing
Checks interactions between different modules.

*(Other types such as performance, load, and unit testing are usually out of QA manual scope but are included here for completeness.)*
